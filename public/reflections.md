# JAI'S REFLECTION!!

##  5 Topics Discussed That I Know Very Well

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

#### * This was one of the first topics that was taught to me, and it has been quite ubiquitous in CS3 and will be in the following years. It's been talked about a lot tp the point that I've gotten used to it.

### 2. If Else Statements

#### Also another classic, it is one of the fundamental things you need to survive in CS. It was one of the first things I understood and since then have sort of mastered. This is very reliable!

### 3. While Loops

#### This is very helpful for doing very very very long processes and I am able to visualize and imagine what's going on easily. I find it easier to understand that for and do loops. I'm a coder who sort of understands a lot but is only able to execute it in a beginner-style code (because I want it to only use things in my codes that I can easily visualize)

### 4. Switch Statements

#### I really like switch statements as they are easy to understand. I am able to visualize them as like a TV and a remote. Inputting a number gives a specific network. They also make life easier and I’m thankful its a thing in the first place. 

### 5. Variable Declaration

#### It is pretty simple in itself but then again there are some possible events where picking the wrong variable or whatever, can lead to an issue in your code. Variable declaration though has been more leaned-back and simple ever since going into javascript.



## 5 Topics Discussed That I Need More Understanding In

### 1. For Loops

#### I’ve really found for loops difficult to understand since grade 8. I understand what happens and how it works but when it comes to nested for loops, my mind starts to slow down and not process what I’m looking at. This is why I resolve to using while loops!!!

### 2. Functions

#### I’ve been starting to get into working with functions, but it’s still quite blurry to me. I can’t really explain into further detail because my understanding is really that vague and basic (sorry sir ToT)

### 3-5 Sir… wala na po akong maisip im sorry :(

## Plan of Action

### I will start taking CS more seriously. I will also start utilizing the supplements given in KHub more. I will also try not to be shy in asking questions, and overall just get used to VSCode and the long way of submitting things. I can also explore the codes, github, and all that more, and start understanding things and getting a hang of everything.



## Most effective

### 1. Diagnostic Test

#### Despite the bad results, it was like a very useful wake up call that made us realize that we could’ve learned more, paid more attention, and put in more effort last year. It made me realize that my critical thinking skills were low. (But buti naman medyo nakabawi na po ako doon :) ) It also gave me a grasp of what I will be tackling in CS3

### 2. Coding exercises

#### All of them were really helpful and played an important role in enhancing my critical thinking skills. Though yes I did miss one exercise, they all still helped me out a lot and I had a talk with sir earlier about my grades, and though they were satisfactory, I knew that I still could’ve done better.

## Least Effective

### NONE!

#### All of them were very helpful and were very important in understanding CS3 early on in the course. Each of them tackles important aspects of coding that we need to become great coders. Each one varies in difficulty, but they all serve their purpose, so really, there’s no “least effective” task, since we really do need the skills from all of them.
